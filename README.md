Installation
===========

####Requirements####

Install `conky` , preferably the package `conky-all` if in the future you want to use some exotic features  
For the mediaplayer "card", you need `python3`  
For the fortune "card", you need `fortune`  
The script uses the following fonts, install them
(see Customization if you wish to use your fonts)
* Antipasto [Download here](http://www.dafont.com/antipasto.font)
* Open Sans [Download here](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans)
* Oswald [Download here](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oswald)

Copy/Move the contents to a directory of your liking and edit the following files to specify this directory by replacing `INSERT_PATH` to your directory. e.g. if the scripts are in `/home/foo/path/to/my/dir` then run
```
$ cd /home/foo/path/to/my/dir
$ sed -i 's:INSERT_PATH:/home/foo/path/to/my/dir:' mediaplayer_rc launch_all.sh
```

Now, set `launch_all.sh` as executable (`chmod u+x launch_all.sh`) and add it to your startup applications. If you don't know how, Google is your friend.
If **after** 10-15 seconds, you don't see conky on your desktop, try running:
```
sed -i -r 's/own_window_type .*/own_window_type normal/' *_rc
```


Customization
=================

**Network**

You might want to replace `enp0s20u1` or `wlp3s0` in `network_rc` with the device you are connected to the internet with  e.g.
```
$ sed -i 's/enp0s20u1/enp0s20u3/' network_rc
```

**Media Player**

Replace `clementine` in `mediaplayer_rc` with the name of your media player (e.g. `vlc`, or `audacious`, or `amarok`).  
This should probably just work (after replacement) if the media player you are using implements MPRIS 2.0 (most players do).
To customize the output, you might want to see `python3 mediaplayer.py --help`

**Fortune**

See `man fortune` and edit the arguments to the fortune call in `fortune_rc`


**Colors**

Each script uses a set of three colors, defined as
* color1 (color)  
Color of the Card heading
* color2 (color)  
Color of the horizontal line stretching from the heading to the right end
* color3 (color)  
Text color  
Here, (color) can be specified using the hexadecimal notation (without the preceding #) or a color name specified in `/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt`  
Examples of legit colors : red, blue, 20efef  
You can change any of the above colors to suit your liking/theme
Examples:  
If you want headings in blue, then run  
```
$ sed -i -r 's/color1 [a-z0-9]+$/color1 0000ff/' *_rc

```
(the [a-z0-9] in the above pattern also matches color names besides the hexadecimal colors)

Similarly, you can change the background color of the 'cards' specified by the variable `own_window_colour (color)`
For transparency, uncomment the lines `#own_window_transparent yes` (by removing the #).  
Background opacity is specified by `own_window_argb_value (value between 0 and 255)`


**Fonts**

The following fonts are used
* Antipasto [Download here](http://www.dafont.com/antipasto.font)  
Font in the which the clock is displayed
* Open Sans [Download here](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/open-sans)  
Font for the general text
* Oswald [Download here](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/oswald)  
Font for the Cards' headings

Substitue them using sed like above.
